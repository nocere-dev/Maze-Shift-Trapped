# Board game

Name: **Maze Shift: Trapped**

Concept: 

- **Shifting Maze**: The board is made up of fixed and moveable maze tiles. On each player's turn, they slide one moveable tile into the maze, shifting the paths and altering the layout.
- **Treasure Hunt**: Players are each given a set of secret treasure cards. Their goal is to navigate the shifting maze to collect their treasures.
- **Movement**: Players move their token along open paths in the maze, but since the layout changes each turn, routes to treasures or other players can quickly become blocked or opened up.
- **Strategy**: Players must plan their moves carefully, both to reach their own objectives and to potentially block or hinder other players.

Rough overview:

Inspiration:
- Labyrinth board game

Rules:
- ### Setup:

	- **Game Board**: The board consists of a grid with a mix of fixed tiles and spaces where movable tiles can be inserted.
	- **Movable Tiles**: These are shuffled and placed randomly on the board, except for one extra tile.
	- **Treasure Cards**: Each player is dealt an equal number of treasure cards. These cards represent the treasures they need to collect, but the cards are kept secret from other players.
	- **Player Tokens**: Players choose a token and place it on their starting point, located at one of the four corners of the board.
	- **Trapped Cards**: Some cards will be marked with a padlock, if a player lands on this card they have the option to roll the dice and take the chance it isn't trapped. If the player rolls an odd number the trap is activated and must move back the number of spaces shown on the dice, if the player rolls an even number the trap is not activated and the player can move forward the number of spaces shown on the dice. Alternatively the player can forfeit the chance and move back one space.

- ### Objective:

	- The goal is to be the first player to collect all of your treasures (as shown on your cards) and return to your starting point.

- ### Gameplay:

	- Each player’s turn consists of two main actions:

	1. **Shifting the Maze**:
    
	    - The extra tile is used to shift the maze.
	    - Players insert this tile into one of the open edges of the board, which pushes an entire row or column of tiles, thus changing the pathways.
	    - One tile is pushed off the board, becoming the new extra tile for the next player.
	2. **Moving Your Token**:
	    
	    - After shifting the maze, players can move their token along the pathways as far as they can or want, but only along connected paths.
	    - Players try to reach the tile that corresponds to the treasure on the top of their treasure deck.
	    - If they reach their treasure, they reveal the card and draw the next one from their deck.

- ### Special Rules:

	- **Blocked Paths**: You can only move along continuous paths, so if the maze is shifted and a path is blocked, you may be stuck.
	- **Moving Limits**: Players are allowed to move any distance along open pathways, but only in one continuous movement.
	- **Maze Manipulation**: Players can shift the maze strategically, not just to reach their own treasure, but also to block opponents or make it harder for them to reach theirs.

- ### Winning the Game:

	- The game ends when a player collects all of their treasure cards and returns to their starting corner. That player is declared the winner.

- ### Additional Rules:

	- **Forbidden Moves**: You can’t push a tile back into the same row/column that was shifted by the previous player.
	- **Token Interaction**: Players' tokens cannot land on the same space; they must plan to avoid one another.
