      <h2>Story</h2>
    </summary>
</ul>

>In what remains of a broken world, survival alone is not enough. You have been captured by *The Architect*, the overseer of this shattered reality, and chosen to endure his brutal game—*Maze Shift*. This ever-shifting labyrinth conceals ancient artifacts, relics from a world long gone, that may be your only key to freedom. But the maze holds dark secrets. Monsters lurk in the shadows, and the greatest threat may come from those trapped beside you.
>
>Trust no one. Escape is the only option. Only those who outwit both the labyrinth and their rivals will survive. Will you claim your freedom, or fall victim to the eternally changing maze?

      <h2>Concept</h2>
    </summary>
</ul>

### **Shifting Maze**: 
The board is made up of fixed and moveable maze tiles. On each player's turn, they slide one moveable tile into the maze, shifting the paths and altering the layout.
  
### **Treasure Hunt**: 
Throughout the deck of path cards there are secret treasure cards and trapped cards. Their goal is to navigate the shifting maze to collect treasures and escape.
  
### **Movement**: 
Players move their token along open paths in the maze, but since the layout changes each turn, routes to treasures or other players can quickly become blocked or opened up.
  
### **Strategy**: 
Players must plan their moves carefully, both to reach their own objectives and to potentially block or hinder other players.

      <h1>Setup & Rules</h1>
    </summary>
</ul>

### **Game Board**: 
The board consists of a grid with a mix of fixed tiles and spaces where movable tiles can be inserted.
  
### **Movable Tiles**: 
These are shuffled and placed randomly on the board, with a deck of left over tiles with random treasures or traps on them throughout. Each player is dealt an equal amount of 5 cards at the start.
  
### **Ability Cards**: 
Each player is also dealt 5 ability cards, these cards can be used to escape unfortunate situations like if you get trapped you could "nullify" the trap so it doesn't go off.
  
### **Player Tokens**: 
Players choose a token and place it on their starting point, located at one of the centre of the board.
  
### **Trapped Cards**: 
Some cards will be marked with a padlock, if a player lands on this card they have the option to roll the dice and take the chance it isn't trapped. If the player rolls an odd number the trap is activated and must move back the number of spaces shown on the dice, if the player rolls an even number the trap is not activated and the player can move forward the number of spaces shown on the dice. Alternatively the player can forfeit the chance and move back one space.
  
### **Monsters**: 
Depending on the amount of players there will either be 1 or 2 hunters, these players will start at the corners of the board and try to work their way inwards to kill the escapees.

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    </summary>
</ul>

Each player’s turn consists of two main actions:

### **Shifting the Maze**:
	    
The extra tile is used to shift the maze.
   
Players insert this tile into one of the open edges of the board, which pushes an entire row or column of tiles, thus changing the pathways.

One tile is pushed off the board, becoming the new extra tile for the next player.
          
### **Moving Your Token**:
		    
After shifting the maze, players will roll a dice and move their token along the pathways as many tiles as displayed on the die, but only along connected paths.
   
Players try to reach the a treasure while avoiding the monsters.
   
Collecting a treasure allows them to escape, collecting extra treasures will give the player an extra life per treasure.
   
If the player lands on a trap, they have the opportunity to use an ability card and escape if they have the right card. Alternatively, the player can test their luck and roll a die to see if they survive or not.

      <h2>Special Rules:</h2>
    </summary>
</ul>

### **Blocked Paths**: 
You can only move along continuous paths, so if the maze is shifted and a path is blocked, you may be stuck.
  
### **Moving Limits**: 
Players are allowed to move only the distance shown on the dice.
  
### **Maze Manipulation**: 
Players can shift the maze strategically, not just to reach treasure, but also to block opponents or make it harder for them to acquire some for themselves.

      <h2>Winning The Game:</h2>
    </summary>
</ul>

The game ends when a player collects at least one treasure and escapes through an escape route. That player is declared the winner.

      <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
    </summary>
</ul>

### **Forbidden Moves**: 
You can’t push a tile back into the same row/column that was shifted by the previous player.
  
### **Token Interaction**: 
Players' tokens cannot land on the same space; they must plan to avoid one another.
